# High Variance Books

I've taken to reading a lot lately and was inspired to find out which books are highly polarizing. There are several books which attract as much love as they attract discontent and I am on a personal mission to quantify how polarizing some books are. 
For this, I am using reviews data from goodreads. 

# How to run 
Running books_scraper.py will gather books from the shelf "" and store them in a json file with the review data and ratings.
