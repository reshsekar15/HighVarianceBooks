# High Variance Books

I've taken to reading a lot lately and was inspired to find out which books are highly polarizing. There are several books which attract as much love as they attract discontent and I am on a personal mission to quantify how polarizing some books are. For the time being, as I am still learning statistics, I have used standard deviation to see how dispersed ratings are. 

# Data Used

For this, I am using reviews data from goodreads. I am using beautiful soup to scrape books data from one shelf. 

# How to run 

Running books_scraper.py will gather books from the shelf "" and store them in a json file with the review data and ratings. 

# Results

# Use cases

# Scope

The plan is to expand scope by adding more books into the dataset, collecting more reviews etc.
